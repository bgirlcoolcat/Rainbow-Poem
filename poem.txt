Oh where has the original rainbow verse gone? 
A day to smile and not to pout!
"I love Earth Day.", says Peter Pony.
"TOdaaay is 28th December 2016...!!!"
Today is Thursday. 
I enjoy macoroni
Today is raining
Yesterday was sunny skies.
"Well I love the sea," sang the stupendous starfish.
Earth Day is my favorite color
